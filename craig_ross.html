        For over a decade, Craig has partnered with C-Suite executives, leaders and teams elevating performance within global organizations. His understanding of current business trends and needs, along with access to thousands of leaders in numerous industries, allows Craig to deliver innovative leadership strategies to Verus Global’s expanding client base. He works with inspired leaders serious about putting values into action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout each Verus Global process (from executive coaching to keynotes to the flagship Pathways to Leadership® Process), Craig has equipped many leaders and organizations to dramatically improve performance with sustainable breakthroughs. With Craig’s high-energy and dynamic approach, he assists teams in quickly creating alignment, communication and trust, so they can better achieve their strategic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craig has a passion for partnering with leaders who truly want to realize and activate potential in every interaction of every day. These leaders know that when you change someone’s life, you change how they perform – and how they choose to lend their discretionary efforts. He believes what many of our client-partners do: emotionally intelligent leaders and high-performing teams aren’t just a goal – they’re an approach essential to building a better life and creating sustainable change.

        Currently, Craig is co-authoring <i>One Team</i> with team member Dr. Angie Paccione. Craig and Verus Global Founder Steve Vannoy, are co-authors of the award-winning books, <a href="http://www.verusglobal.com/wp/?book=stomp-the-elephant" target="_blank"><i>Stomp the Elephant in the Office</i></a> (Wister &amp; Willows, 2008) and <a href="http://www.verusglobal.com/wp/?book=degrees-of-strength" target="_blank"><i>Degrees of Strength</i></a> (Wister &amp; Willows, 2012), filled with insights and practical tools to effectively influence and shape any work environment. The tools in these books equip everyone to be more productive, inspired and able to bring the best expression of themselves to work (and home) every day. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Empowering and supporting educators is an additional passion of Craig’s. He currently serves on the board of advisors for the University of Colorado at Denver’s Jake Jabs Center for Entrepreneurship. As well, you’ll find him regularly supporting K-12 educators in his local community by equipping them with 21st century leadership skills. He served on the Board of Directors for TP Mechanical (Ohio) from 2009-2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        He received a B.A. in English from the University of Minnesota at Morris (go Cougars!) and a Masters in Curriculum Instruction and Design at Colorado Christian University. He joined Verus Global in 1999, bringing a background in curriculum design incredible passion and discipline for effective training and development programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craig began life on a small farm in rural Minnesota and now lives in Sedalia, Colorado. When Craig’s not working there’s a good chance you’ll find him outside playing and laughing with his bride, Amanda, and their children: Shea, Jolie, Lara, and Grey.
